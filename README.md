## üí° About The Project

Sages Web was envisioned as a modern, centralized **directory for spiritual teachers and their teachings**. The goal was to create a platform where users could discover, learn from, and connect with various spiritual guides from around the world.

The foundational step for this vision was to build a secure and feature-rich user management system, which is the current state of the project.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Status: On Hold

This project is currently on hold. The core authentication system and user settings pages have been fully developed and are operational. Future development is paused at this time.

---

## ‚ú® Features

Sages Web's primary focus was to build a secure, performant, and modern authentication experience without relying on third-party authentication libraries.

* **Custom Authentication:** The entire authentication flow is built from the ground up using TypeScript, providing full control over the user experience and security model.
    * **Session-Based:** Uses secure, HTTP-only session cookies for user authentication.
    * **Credential & OAuth Login:** Supports standard sign-up/sign-in with username/email and password, as well as OAuth providers for social logins.
* **Email Verification:** New users receive a verification link via email (powered by **Resend**) and must confirm their address before gaining full access.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Users can enhance their account security by enabling 2FA through their settings page.
* **High-Performance Sessions:** User sessions are cached in **Upstash Redis**, enabling near-instantaneous reads and writes for a faster, more responsive authentication experience compared to traditional database lookups.
* **Modern UI:** Built with **ShadCn UI** for a sleek, accessible, and customizable component library.
